# TimeLine_RoadMap

## General Concept:

### I wanted to make a tool I could use to track my characters in the game I am making as they each move on their own schedules from location to location. This tool allows me to add all of the characters, all of the locations, and all of the events that happen. I am then able to add people to different events on different days and track their movement from location to location, event to event. This tool is not perfected as of yet, there are still a few features I want to add such as clicking on a person and having their path be highlighted, and making it possible to edit the event information from the application once the event is created.
